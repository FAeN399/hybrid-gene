## The Nine Seeds

### 1. COMBAT
**The heartbeat.**

Real-time flow. No menus. No turns. Position matters.
Monsters fight — you command. Sometimes they listen.

Energy depletes. Regeneration slows.
The longer the battle, the more desperate the tactics.

Hit stagger. Screen shake. The weight of impact.
When your command flashes green: acknowledged.
When it flashes red: ignored.

They have opinions.

---

### 2. BREEDING
**The legacy.**

Parents become children become legends.
Stats carry forward — diminished and multiplied.

G1 are the seeds: real creatures, limited potential.
G2 are hybrids: mixed blood, expanded ceiling.
G3 are myths: dragons and phoenixes, the peak of natural breeding.
G4 are secrets: deities born from cross-species union.

The formula remembers the parents.
The birthmark is pure chance.

You cannot breed perfection.
You can only approach it.

---

### 3. MONSTERS
**The roster.**

One hundred creatures across four species.
Each born with a mark that shapes who they become.

**Insect**: Fast but fragile in mind. Medium temper.
**Mammal**: Intelligent and balanced. Reasonable.
**Reptilian**: Strong and stubborn. Aggressive.
**Avian**: Quick and clever but glass-boned. Peaceful until cornered.

Flying types dance above melee range.
But ranged attacks find them easily.

Every monster has a Core AI buried beneath commands.
When orders fail, instinct surfaces.

---

### 4. AUTONOMY
**The soul.**

This is the heart of the design.

INT determines understanding.
Can the monster comprehend what you're asking?

Temperament determines willingness.
Does the monster *want* to obey?

Low INT + Low Temperament = chaos.
The creature acts on instinct alone.

High INT + High Temperament = partnership.
The creature becomes an extension of your will.

Wild captures resent you.
You beat them. You took them from home.
Their temperament starts near zero.

Bred monsters trust more.
They know nothing but your care.

The Core AI awakens when commands fail:
- **Aggressive**: Attack. Attack. Attack.
- **Defensive**: Wait. Counter. Survive.
- **Supportive**: Help the ally. Buff. Heal.
- **Evasive**: Run. Dodge. Live another day.

The birthmark decides which voice speaks when you're ignored.

---

### 5. GROWTH
**The grind.**

No levels. No experience bars.
Stats grow from doing.

Attack to grow STR.
Think to grow INT.
Move to grow AGI.
Endure to grow END.

But growth decays.

The stronger you become, the harder it is to grow stronger.
Lower generations hit the ceiling first.
A G1 beetle can match a G3 dragon — but it takes forever.

Birthmarks accelerate or hinder.
+20% STR growth. -20% INT growth.
The mark you're born with shapes the path available.

The ceiling approaches for everyone.
Only the gods (G4) see the sky.

---

### 6. CAPTURE
**The hunt.**

Weaken. Tranquilize. Carry home.

Below 25% HP: the window opens.
At 25%: 50% success.
At 5%: guaranteed.

But the battle might continue.
And asleep monsters can wake.

Once tranquilized, you carry.
Half speed. No items. Vulnerable.
If you die, you lose them.

The rarer the creature, the deeper the wilderness.
The deeper the wilderness, the longer the walk home.

Wild ones hate you.
Temperament starts at rock bottom.
Trust must be earned through care.

---

### 7. WORLD
**The island.**

Four regions. Four species. Four arenas.

You start where the insects swarm.
Forest floor. Buzzing ambition.

Mountains hold the mammals.
Caves echo with howls.

Swamps and deserts hide the reptiles.
Cold blood. Hot tempers.

The peaks belong to the birds.
Thin air. Sharp eyes.

Each region: twenty screens of wilderness.
Caves with loot. Structures with bosses.
Secrets that hint at G4 recipes.

The path forward unlocks at Rank B.
Or skip everything at Rank S.

---

### 8. ARENA
**The climb.**

D rank to S rank.
Brackets and ladders.
Names on a board.

B rank opens doors.
S rank skips them.

No weight classes.
Bring your gods to the rookie league if you want.
Nobody will stop you.
Nobody will respect you either.

The arena pays.
Gold. Items. Ingredients.
Sometimes: monsters.

NPC names fill the ladder.
You can challenge them outside tournaments.
They remember you.

---

### 9. FEEL
**The juice.**

Digimon World 1 meets Link to the Past.

Monsters that feel alive.
Combat that flows like water.

Hit stagger interrupts.
Screen shake punctuates.
Sound sells the impact.

Green flash: obeyed.
Red flash: ignored.

Commands have cooldowns.
You cannot spam.
You must choose.

The monster that ignores your command and wins anyway.
The breeding chain that finally produces the mythic.
The G1 beetle that defeats a G3 dragon through pure grinding.

Those are the moments.

---

## ○

**BRIDGE**

Above: systems. Mechanics. Numbers.
Below: the fantasy of raising something that grows beyond your control.

The game is not about perfect obedience.
The game is about partnership with imperfect creatures.

You are commander and coach.
Not puppeteer.

The monster has opinions.
That's the point.

---

## BRAIN

### Soil
*Where did this come from?*

- Digimon World 1's autonomous monsters — the frustration and joy of imperfect control
- Exhaustion with turn-based Pokemon combat — wanting action, flow, real-time decisions
- The question that started it all: *What if the monster had opinions?*
- Link to the Past's combat feel — fluid, responsive, satisfying even in 2D

### Roots
*What patterns emerged that weren't planned?*

- [To be filled as development progresses]
- [What surprised you about the design?]
- [What systems connected in unexpected ways?]

### Synapses
*What connects?*

```
Autonomy ←→ Growth
  Smarter monsters obey better.
  Training INT is training trust.

Breeding ←→ Combat
  Parents determine child's ceiling.
  The best fighters come from the best bloodlines.

Capture ←→ Temperament
  Wild ones need taming.
  Violence creates resentment.
  Care creates loyalty.

Generations ←→ Decay
  Higher gens have higher ceilings.
  But even G1 can reach the sky — eventually.

Feel ←→ Autonomy
  The red flash of defiance.
  The green flash of partnership.
  Both must feel meaningful.
```

### Open
*What questions remain?*

- [ ] **Permanent death**: Should monsters die permanently? Would create emotional stakes but also frustration. Optional hardcore mode?
- [ ] **Damage types**: Add elemental weaknesses? Risks becoming Pokemon rock-paper-scissors. Current design avoids this intentionally.
- [ ] **Multiplayer**: Core feature or scope creep? PvP arenas would be natural fit. But requires balance pass.
- [ ] **Currency name**: "Gold" is placeholder. What fits the world?
- [ ] **Lifespans**: Should monsters age and die naturally? Digimon World did this. Adds urgency and attachment cycle.
- [ ] **Day/night**: Affect spawns? Behaviors? Or just aesthetic?
- [ ] **Crafting depth**: How complex? Too simple = boring. Too complex = bloat.

### Seen
*What have you learned about yourself through building this?*

- [To be filled as development progresses]
- [What does this project reveal about what you value in games?]
- [What design decisions were hard to make? What does that say?]
