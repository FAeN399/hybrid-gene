# Gatekeep

Task coordination and standards documentation.

---

## Purpose

**Document before you build.**

Gatekeep ensures team members work in compatible ways by defining standards BEFORE work begins. If a task doesn't have documentation here, it shouldn't be started.

---

## How It Works

1. **Task identified** — Someone wants to work on tilesets, monsters, UI, etc.
2. **Standards documented** — Gatekeep file created defining specs, formats, conventions
3. **Task assigned** — Work can begin with clear guidelines
4. **Updates logged** — Any changes to standards go through Gatekeep

---

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Tasks.md` | Active tasks and assignments |
| `Standards/` | How-to documentation for each system |
| `ID-Register.md` | Master ID allocation |
| `Open-Questions.md` | Decisions pending resolution |

---

## Standards Index

Before working on any system, check for its standards doc:

- `Standards/Tilesets.md` — Tile dimensions, layering, naming
- `Standards/Monsters.md` — Sprite specs, animation frames, naming
- `Standards/Audio.md` — Formats, volumes, naming conventions
- `Standards/UI.md` — Colors, fonts, component specs
- `Standards/Data.md` — JSON structure, file organization

---

## Rules

1. **No standards = No work** — Don't start without documentation
2. **One source of truth** — Gatekeep is the authority
3. **Update before deviating** — Change the doc first, then the work
4. **Ask if unclear** — Ambiguity causes incompatibility

---

*The Gatekeeper prevents rework.*
